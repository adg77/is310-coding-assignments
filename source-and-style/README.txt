The website I decided to investigate was BaseballRefrence.com. 
The website is mainly built on HTML, with CSS mixed in for style. I didn't find any JavaScript files on the websites main page, but there is not GitHub repository available for the website so I might have missed it in the 11,000 lines of HTML and CSS. It is interesting to see the GitHub repos I found related to the website though; lots of data scrapers that pull from the website, like this one:

Back to baseball reference, I would guess a decently large team constructed this website. As previously mentioned, 11,000 lines of code for just the homepage would take someone a very long time to make by themselves. Looking deeper at some of the code further strengthens this belief, with complex buttons and links to so many different places and a homepage that updates daily. Another hint is the text memos that were left in the HTML reads like messages to other developers. For example, one of these reads "all sr sites together */ /* I believe linker works as a parameter here, although there didn\'t seem to be a simple "true" value to set besides this one --NW https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gtagjs/cross-domain Add configs for both sets of code". It is interesting to see how most of the site was put together, and how complex simple things like buttons or hyperlinks can get so complex when put into a website like this. I think the most interesting part was seeing the code the team put in to work with google, like ad blockers and key word options.
