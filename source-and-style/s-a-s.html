                <p style= "font-size: small;" >Linked above is Week 4 2024 AP Poll with Illinois ranked 4th. </p>  
<p>Illinois football has been historically weak, with a couple years as an exeception. This year, we should all watch and enjoy
        a rare good Illinois Football Team!  </p>
    <p>Some reasons why I believe this:</p>
        <ul> 
        <li>Illinois is ranked 19th in the country this week! </li>
        <li>Quarterback <span style='color: #FF7A59'>Luke Altmyer </span> has been playing like a hiesman contender through 4 weeks!</li>
        <li>Defense is as tough as ever, creating tons of turnovers!</li>
        <li>Beat 2 ranked opponents, the most in the country!</li>
    </ul>
<h2 style="font-size: xx-large; color:blue">Why you should pay attention</h2>
    <p>Look no further than next weeks game against Penn State, the #9 team in the county. 
    Illinois has to play a great game to beat them, but it is not impossible. If Illinois manages to win, however, they will
    likely be ranked the highest they have since the early 2000's. Don't miss the oppurtinity to see one of the best Illinois teams 
    of your life!
