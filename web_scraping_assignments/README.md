I chose A Song of Ice and Fire Wiki to webscrape, as I'm a huge Game of Thrones fan. I read the books 3 years ago, and like
many others I am patiently waiting for the next entry, The Winds of Winter. I scraped the titles of every novel in the saga from the Wiki along with all released sample chapters, with the names and number of chapters released. This data will hopefully be used to track George's writing process on the book, and can be used to estimate on when the next one is released. He seems to be nearing closer, but no one can really tell. 

What you need: 
Python in a venv, with request, beautifalsoup, and csv installed and imported. 

Here is a link to the robots.txt file for the wiki:

And the two URL's I used for the project:
