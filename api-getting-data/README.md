I picked An API of Ice and Fire, an API based on the Game of Thrones book series and shows.
I pulled up the data available for House Stark, where many of the main characters in the series hail from.
This includes members of the house, where they live, founding date and other facts about them.
From the Europeana API, I pulled results relating to the place Dubrovnik. This is where the Kings Landing scenes
were shot in the Game of Thrones TV show, and the Starks have a famous problem of dying whenever they go south to places
like Kings landing. So, it's kind of a warning for them to stay away from places that look like the linked paintings of the city.
